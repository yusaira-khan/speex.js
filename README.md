Speex Codec in Meteor
=========================

With support for Meteor. Meteor considers top level var declarations as IIFE instead of global variables.

Still unmodified

Speex Codec in Javascript. Ported speex-1.2.0RC using emscripten tool. 

* Both encoder and decoder (see [demo](http://jpemartins.github.com/speex.js/))

* [aurora.js](http://github.com/ofmlabs/aurora.js) integration (see [demo](http://jpemartins.github.com/speex.js/aurora.html))

(Microphone loopback is only working in Firefox.)
